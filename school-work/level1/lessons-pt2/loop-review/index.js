/**
 * QUIZ:
 * 
 * 1. Why do programmers care about loops? What are they good for?
 *      allow a programer to run the same code many times.
 *      allows it without copying or repasting the code
 * 
 * 2. In a for loop, what are the 3 main parts that go in the parentheses?
 *      (1. initialize variables, 2 condition - should I run one more
 *      time? 3. final code we want to run at the end of the loop)
 * 
 * 3. Write a loop that logs the numbers 15 to 50 (inclusive) to the console.
 *      for(var i = 15; i <= 50, i++){
 *          console.log(i)
 *      }
 * 
 * 4 Write a loop that logs the numbers 0 to 10 (inclusive) to the console, but if the number is 7, it also logs "I't's your lucky day!"
 *      for(var i = 0; i <= 10, i++){
 *          console.log(i)
 *          if(i === 7){
 *              console.log("It's your lucky day!")
 *          }
 *      }
 *
